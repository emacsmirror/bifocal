* Description
* Split-screen scrolling
  To enable split-screen scrolling, add the following to your ~.emacs~:
  #+begin_src elisp
  (require 'shx-split)
  #+end_src

  Now paging up causes a comint-mode window to be split in two, with a larger
  window on top and a smaller input window preserved on the bottom:
  #+begin_src
  +--------------+
  | -------      |
  | -------      |
  | -------      |
  |    [head]    |
  |(show history)|
  +--------------+
  |    [tail]    |
  |(show context)|
  +--------------+
  #+end_src
  Paging down to the bottom causes the split to disappear.

  This lets you enter text at the prompt (in the input window) and monitor new
  input, while consulting previous output (in the scrolling window)
  uninterrupted.

  Change the height of the tail to something else by customizing the
  ~shx-split-rows~ variable.
